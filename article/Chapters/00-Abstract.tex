\chapter*{Abstract}
% \guideinfo{In the \textit{Abstract} section, provide a concise summary of your project, highlighting the key points. Begin with a brief statement of the problem or objective, followed by a description of your approach or methodology. Summarise the main results or findings, emphasising their significance or implications. Conclude with a sentence or two on the overall contribution or impact of your work. Keep the abstract clear and focused, ideally within 150-250 words, to give readers a quick understanding of your research and its importance.}

This guide is intended for those who are beginning their study of quantum information and its implementation using Qiskit. It is originally based on the \href{https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en}{IBM Learning Course}. The document primarily covers seven modules from the course: Quantum Mechanics, Computer Science, Basics of Quantum Information, Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms, General Formulation of Quantum Information, Foundations of Quantum Error Correction, Quantum Computing in Practice, and Quantum Chemistry with VQE and Quantum Diagonalization Algorithms.
Each topic is grounded in deep mathematical and technical foundations, but the IBM course is designed to be accessible to general audiences. This guide aims to elaborate on the content of these modules and provide detailed explanations and answers to the accompanying discussion problems.
