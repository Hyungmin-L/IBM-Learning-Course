I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Chaeyeon Park, whose guidance and encouragement were invaluable throughout the preparation of this project. Her insights and unwavering support made this work possible.

I am also sincerely thankful to Junseok Jung, a graduate student whose thoughtful advice and expertise provided me with both technical direction and motivation during the development process.

Special thanks go to my close friends and collaborators, Seokwon Choi and Jungbin Ho, for their active participation in discussions and their companionship throughout the IBM Quantum Learning Course. Their presence made this journey both intellectually rewarding and personally meaningful.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the organizers and contributors of the IBM Quantum Learning Course, whose efforts in designing and delivering the program laid the foundation for this project. Their dedication to advancing quantum education was a true inspiration.
